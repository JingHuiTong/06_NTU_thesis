Global azimuthal anisotropy model for SV waves (Yuan and Beghein, EPSL, 2013).
Model is stored in General Spherical Harmonics (GSH) up to degree 20.

The FORTRAN code "gsh2xyz_2psi.f" does the conversion from GSH to geographical coordinates. For usage and details, see comments in the code.

The model format is as follows:
lon lat dlnG fast-axis-direction(w.r.t. North) dlnGc dlnGs


dlnG = G/L where L is the elastic parameter associated with Vsv
dlnGc and dlnGs are derived from inversion of the cos and sin terms of the phase velocity maps of Visser et al. (2008).
